# A CNN and Entropy-Based Hybrid Model for Robust DeepfakeÂ Detection

### **ðŸ“„ Overview**

This project presents a novel hybrid deepfake detection model that integrates **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **entropy-based randomness analysis**. Designed to overcome the limitations of existing CNN-only models, especially against high-quality, fine-grained deepfakes, our approach significantly enhances classification reliability and reduces false positives.

Deepfake technology, while having legitimate uses in fields like education and entertainment, has been increasingly exploited for malicious activities such as **misinformation, identity fraud, blackmail, and online scams**. Traditional CNN-based detectors often struggle with advanced deepfakes due to their reliance solely on visual cues and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. 

Our hybrid model addresses this by combining the robust spatial feature extraction capabilities of DenseNet-121 with the statistical regularities identified through Shannon entropy, capturing inconsistencies inherent in GAN-generated images.
